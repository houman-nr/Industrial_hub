## Description:
This project involves the development of a web platform designed to facilitate direct sales of rice between producers and consumers, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Built with a user-friendly and modern interface, the website enables companies to showcase their production processes and products through virtual tours, helping customers gain transparent insights into product origins.
## Key Features:
Direct Sales: Allows customers to purchase rice directly from producers, simplifying the buying process and building trust.
Virtual Tours: Companies can create virtual tours by uploading images, videos, and descriptions, providing potential customers with a detailed view of the production process.
User Feedback: Customers can leave feedback on virtual tours, which is visible to all users, fostering an informed decision-making environment.
Registration and Personal Pages: Companies register to create their profiles and manage their tours, making it easy to update their product displays.
## Technologies:
Frontend: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure responsiveness and compatibility across devices.
Backend: Built with the Django framework in Python, using SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production, allowing for efficient data management and secure transactions.
